This repository contains the benign and malicious EMLs powering the Sublime labs available
at [labs.sublime.security](https://labs.sublime.security/signup).

You're welcome to use these EMLs however you like, and we welcome contributions, including improvements of existing
labs and entire new labs.

You may also [deploy the Lab environment locally](https://docs.sublimesecurity.com/docs/quickstart-docker) with Docker if you prefer. After deploying the Sublime Platform, navigate to `/signup` to initialize the Labs.
