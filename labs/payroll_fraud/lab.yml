  ## Brief

  Phishing emails are being received impersonating staff members.

  These emails target HR/Finance staff and request a change to the bank details used for salary payments.

  ## Focus Areas
  - Sender analysis
  - Header analysis
  - Content analysis
  - NLU (Natural Language Understanding)

hints:
  - markdown: |
      For this lab, we can filter for emails that have an known organisation display name, but are not a previous sender:
    source: |
      type.inbound
      and sender.display_name in $org_display_names
      and sender.email.email not in $sender_emails

  - markdown: |
      To filter for emails only destined for HR people, we could use something like this which leverages a list for dynamic lookup:
    source: |
      type.inbound
      and any(recipients.to, any($hr_users, .email == ..email.email))

  - markdown: |
      To analyse the tone and intent of the message with our Natural Language Understanding ML, we could use something like this, which also looks for a specific financial 'entity' in the body:
    source: |
      type.inbound
      and any(ml.nlu_classifier(coalesce(body.html.display_text, body.plain.raw)).intents,
        .name in ("bec") and .confidence == "high"
      )
      and any(ml.nlu_classifier(coalesce(body.html.display_text, body.plain.raw)).entities,
        .name == "financial" and strings.icontains(.text, "salary")
      )
