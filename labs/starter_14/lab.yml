      `strings.levenshtein` and `strings.ilevenshtein` are used to calculate the [Levenshtein edit distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance)
      between two strings. The returned value is equal to the minimum number of character operations (deletion, insertion,
      substitution) required to transform one string into the other.
      
      For example, this returns `2`, since `strings.levenshtein` is case-sensitive:
    source: |
      strings.levenshtein('Bat', 'bot')

  - markdown: |
      One powerful application of Levenshtein distance is to detect impersonation:
    source: |
      strings.ilevenshtein(sender.display_name, "Elvis Presley") < 3
