      For this lab, we want to focus on emails with PDF attachments. We could use a snippet like the following to achieve this:
    source: |
      type.inbound
      and any(attachments,
        .file_type == "pdf"
      )

              .name == "Adobe"

      We want to filter out any legitimate emails from the impersonated brand, which we could do with something like this:
    source: |
      type.inbound
      and not strings.ilike(sender.email.domain.root_domain, "adobe.*")


  - markdown: |
      We could use `file.explode` and OCR to look for a known phishing lure in the PDF with something like this:
    source: |
      type.inbound and 
      any(attachments,
        .file_extension == "pdf" and 
        any(file.explode(.),
          strings.ilike(.scan.ocr.raw, "*shared web archived document*") 
        ) 
      )
