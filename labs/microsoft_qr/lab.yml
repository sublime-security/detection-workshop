  ## Brief

  Threat actors are sending fake 'Microsoft' emails.

  These emails contain a single image that includes a QR code. The user is encouraged to scan these QR codes to refresh their Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to prevent losing access to their account.

  These links typically send the user to a credential theft site, for example a fake login portal, not to any Microsoft related service.
