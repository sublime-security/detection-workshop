      For this lab, we're concerned with HTML-based email attachments, which we could hunt for like this, either using a known file extension or the analysed file type:
    source: |
      type.inbound and 
      any(attachments, 
        regex.icontains(.file_extension, '^[sdx]{0,1}ht[ml]{0,2}') or 
        .file_type == 'html'
      )
  
  - markdown: |
      We could look in the file for specific string snippets using MQL like this:
    source: |
      type.inbound
      and any(attachments, 
        .file_extension in ("html", "htm") and 
        any(file.explode(.), 
            any(.scan.strings.strings, strings.ilike(.,
                // Double Base64 encoded zips
                "*VUVzREJCUUFBUUFJQ*",
                "*VFc0RCQlFBQVFBSU*",
                "*VRXNEQkJRQUFRQUlB*",
                // Reversed base64 strings double encoded zips
                "*QJFUUBFUUCJERzVUV*",
                "*USBFVQBFlQCR0cFV*",
                "*BlUQRFUQRJkQENXRV*"
            ))
        )
      )
