name: 4. WASM Smuggling with YARA
description: Hunt for WASM smuggling attachments using YARA
details: |
  ## Brief

  Threat actors have added a new HTML smuggling technique to their arsenal - WebAssembly (WASM) Smuggling. This leverages the WASM technology to obfuscate and deliver malicious payloads, links and other web content.

  In this example, we have an executable - a file format typically blocked by default by mail gateways - embedded within an HTML file leveraging WASM Smuggling.

hints:
  - markdown: |
      We can filter for HTML files with MQL like this:
    source: |
      type.inbound and 
      any(attachments, 
        regex.icontains(.file_extension, '^[sdx]{0,1}ht[ml]{0,2}') or 
        .file_type == 'html'
      )
  
  - markdown: |
      We can filter for HTML files that match on any of our installed Yara signatures like this:
    source: |
      type.inbound
      and any(attachments,
        (
          regex.imatch(.file_extension, '^[sdx]{0,1}ht[ml]{0,2}$')
          or .file_extension in~ $file_extensions_common_archives
          or .file_type == "html"
        )
        and any(file.explode(.),
          length(.scan.yara.matches) > 0
        )
      )
