name: 'Starter 8: Detecting inconsistencies'
description: Find the message where the sender (From) and Return-path are mismatched
hints:
  - markdown: |
      The return path header is available at `headers.return_path`:
    source: |
      headers.return_path.email
  - markdown: |
      There's a great variety of suspicious inconsistencies you can detect with MQL, like a message only containing a
      link that doesn't match the sender:
    source: |
      length(body.links) == 1
      and sender.email.domain.root_domain not in $free_email_providers
      and all(body.links,
        .href_url.domain.root_domain != sender.email.domain.root_domain
      )
