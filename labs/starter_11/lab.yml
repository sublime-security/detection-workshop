      Sublime automatically syncs Google Groups and Microsoft distribution lists, which can then be used to define
      rules based on group membership:
    source: |
      any($org_vips, .email == sender.display_name)
  - markdown: |
      Each entry in the group list includes the member's display name and email address:
    source: |
      any($org_vips, .email == sender.email.email)
  - markdown: |
      In a looping function, you can access a loop item from a parent scope with an additional `.`, such as `..`
      
      And remember, you can loop over an array inside a loop over an array:
    source: |
      any(recipients.to, any($org_vips, .email == ..email.email))
