      The [MDM](https://docs.sublime.security/docs/mdm) includes fields for accessing message recipients:
      
      - `recipients.to`
      - `recipients.cc`
      - `recipients.bcc`
      
      For example, to find messages with bob@example.com Cc'd:
    source: |
      any(recipients.cc, .email.email == 'bob@example.com')

  - markdown: |
      Loop through all recipients by creating an array of arrays:
    source: |
      any([recipients.to, recipients.cc, recipients.bcc], 
        any(., .email.domain.domain in $disposable_email_providers)
      )
