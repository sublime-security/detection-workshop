hints:
  - markdown: |
      MQL supports a variety of [string functions](https://docs.sublime.security/docs/strings-module) to manipulate and
      compare strings:
    source: |
      strings.contains(subject.subject, 'overdue')

  - markdown: |
      Most string functions have a case-insensitive variant:
    source: |
      any(attachments, strings.icontains(.file_name, 'OVERDUE'))
