  ## Brief

  An IcedID malware delivery mechanism. 
  
  An Adobe-branded PDF with a link to a remotely-hosted, password-protected zip. 
  
  The zip contains an ISO, with an LNK and a hidden folder of a CMD and DLL payload (renamed to a .DAT). 
  
  On launch, the DAT file is copied to AppData and executed.

  - PDF analysis
  - Link analysis

hints:

      For this lab, we want to focus on emails with PDF attachments. We could use a snippet like the following to achieve this:
    source: |
      type.inbound
      and any(attachments,
        .file_type == "pdf"
      )
  
  - markdown: |
      To analyse all the links in the PDF, we could use a snippet like this:
    source: |
      type.inbound and
      any(attachments, 
        any(file.explode(.),
          any(.scan.pdf.urls, 
              not strings.ilike(.domain.root_domain, "abobe.*")
          )
        )
      )

  - markdown: |
      To analyse any files downloaded from the analysed links, we could use something like this, which matches on any encrypted zips:
    source: |
      type.inbound
      and any(attachments, 
        any(file.explode(.),
          any(.scan.pdf.urls, 
            any(ml.link_analysis(.).files_downloaded,
              any(file.explode(.), 
                any(.flavors.yara, . == "encrypted_zip")  
              )
            )
          )
        )
      )

      We can be very specific with which files we expect to be present at each level of the downloaded ZIP with MQL like this:
    source: |
      type.inbound
      and any(attachments,
          .file_extension == "pdf" and 
          any(file.explode(.),
              any(.scan.pdf.urls,
                  any(ml.link_analysis(.).files_downloaded,
                      any(file.explode(.), .depth == 0 and any(.flavors.yara, . == "encrypted_zip"))
                      and any(file.explode(.), .depth == 1 and .file_extension == "iso")
                      and any(file.explode(.), .depth == 2 and .file_extension == "lnk")
                  )
              )
          )
      )
