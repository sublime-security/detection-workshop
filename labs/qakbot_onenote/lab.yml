name: 5. Scripts in OneNote Files
description: Hunt for Qakbot malware hiding in Microsoft OneNote files
details: |
  ## Brief

  In early 2023, several malware families, including Qakbot, focused heavily on script files embedded within Microsoft OneNote .one files. Due in part to the lack of Mark-of-the-Web applied to these embedded files (until this was patched by Microsoft!).

  Office 365 lures, amongst others like Adobe, are used to encourage users to launch the scripts. These scripts would then typically download and launch remotely-hosted DLLs to complete infection.

  ## Focus Areas
  - Attachment analysis
  - OCR (Optical Character Recognition)
  - YARA

      We can filter for OneNote files with MQL like this:
    source: |
      type.inbound
      and any(attachments,
          .file_extension in~ ("one", "onepkg")
      )
  
  - markdown: |
      We can filter for OneNote files that match on any of our installed Yara signatures like this:
    source: |
      type.inbound
      and any(attachments,
          .file_extension in~ ("one", "onepkg")
          and any(file.explode(.),
              length(.scan.yara.matches) > 0
          )
      )

      We can hunt for known-bad strings in OneNote files (in archives or otherwise!) using this MQL:

      type.inbound 
      and any(attachments, 
          (
              .file_extension in ("one", "onepkg") or 
              .file_extension in $file_extensions_common_archives
          )
          and any(file.explode(.), 
              any(.flavors.yara, . == "onenote_file")
          ) 
          and any(file.explode(.), 
              (
                  any(.scan.strings.strings, strings.ilike(.,
