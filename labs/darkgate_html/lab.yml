  ## Brief

  A DarkGate malware delivery mechanism.

  An HTML attachment with Microsoft Word branding.
  
  On click, the HTML uses a 'search-ms' protocol handler to present a URL file on a remote server via SMB. 
  
  When executed, this execute a remotely-hosted VBS script that spawns a PowerShell process which creates a new directory, downloads the AutoHotKey executable, a hex-encoded shellcode and an AutoHotKey script that loads the shellcode and executes it to achieve infection.

  ## Focus Areas
  - Attachment analysis
  - HTML smuggling

hints:
  - markdown: |
      For this lab, we're concerned with HTML-based email attachments, which we could hunt for like this, either using a known file extension or the analysed file type:
    source: |
      type.inbound and 
      any(attachments, 
        regex.icontains(.file_extension, '^[sdx]{0,1}ht[ml]{0,2}') or 
        .file_type == 'html'
      )
  
  - markdown: |
      We could look in the file for specific string snippets (like base64-encoded 'search-ms' protocol handlers) using MQL like this:
    source: |
      type.inbound

      and any(attachments,
          regex.imatch(.file_extension, '^[sdx]{0,1}ht[ml]{0,2}$') and
          any(file.explode(.),
              any(.scan.strings.strings, 
                  strings.ilike(.,
                      "*c2VhcmNoLW1zOnF1ZXJ5*", //search-ms:query B64
                      "*5JXZ1FnOz1WLoNmchV2c*", //search-ms:query B64 rev
                      "*c2VhcmNoLW1zOi8vcXVlcnk*", //search-ms://query B64
                      "*knclVXcv8iOz1WLoNmchV2c*", //search-ms://query B64 rev
                      "*c2VhcmNoOnF1ZXJ5*", //search:query B64
                      "*5JXZ1FnOoNmchV2c*", //search:query B64 rev
                      "*search-ms:query*location:\\\\*",
                      "*search:query*location:\\\\*"
                  )
              )
          )
