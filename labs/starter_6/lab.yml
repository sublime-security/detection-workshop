hints:
  - markdown: |
      The MDM includes both the [plaintext and HTML body](https://docs.sublime.security/docs/how-to-detect-keywords-or-phrases-in-the-body) of a message:
    source: |
      any([body.plain.raw, body.html.raw],
        strings.ilike(., "*voicemail*", "*password reset*")
      )
  - markdown: |
      In addition to the raw contents, you can also inspect derived data like `body.html.inner_text` and `body.html.display_text`:
    source: |
      any([body.plain.raw, body.html.inner_text],
        regex.contains(., '\b(\d\d\d)-(\d\d)-(\d\d\d\d)\b')
      )
