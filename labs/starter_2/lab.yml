      Message attachments are available on the `attachments` field of the [MDM](https://docs.sublime.security/docs/mdm),
      with each attachment in the array containing rich information like the `file_name`, `file_type`, and hashes.

      To process an array and loop over elements, MQL uses a few [builtin functions](https://docs.sublime.security/docs/functions#array-looping-functions).
      Array functions loop over an input array with an expression and return another array or some other value. Array
      functions typically take two arguments: the source array, and an expression to evaluate over the elements.
      
      Within the looping expression, use the prefix `.` to access the loop item, and use `.<attribute>` to access an
      attribute of the looping item:
    source: |
      any(attachments, .file_extension == "docx")

  - markdown: |
      You can access attributes multiple levels down:
    source: |
      any(recipients.to, .email.domain.domain in $disposable_email_providers)

  - markdown: |
      You can also create an array by encapsulating a list of values in `[` `]`:
    source: |
      any([recipients.to, recipients.cc, recipients.bcc], 
        any(., .email.domain.domain in $disposable_email_providers)
      )
