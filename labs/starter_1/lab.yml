hints:
  - markdown: |
      Fields can be extracted from the [Message Data Model](https://docs.sublime.security/docs/mdm) (MDM) by specifying the field name. To get a subfield, combine two fields together with a `.` in between.
      
      For example, to retrieve the sender's email address:
    source: |
      sender.email.email

  - markdown: |
      MQL provides [built-in operators](https://docs.sublime.security/docs/syntax#comparing-values) to compare two values. The syntax is `[left] [operator] [right]`:
    source: |
      sender.email.domain.root_domain == "sublimesecurity.com"

  - markdown: |
      The MDM also captures the directionality of email messages using the [`type` property](https://docs.sublime.security/docs/message-types). For example, an inbound message is a message received from a sender outside your organization's domains:
    source: |
      type.inbound
