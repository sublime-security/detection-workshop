Tani,

Yes, I am aware of it.
Thanks for letting me know who

Vince,

I don't know if you are already aware of this, but Maureen Raymond has been taken ill and I understand has received medical advice that she should not travel before the end of next week at the earliest.  
Tara is the appropriate HR representative in London; I will ask her to keep both you and Houston HR informed of the situation.

Many thanks,  Tani
