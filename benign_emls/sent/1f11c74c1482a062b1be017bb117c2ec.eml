John - I got a call from Warren Tashnek today.  He is concerned about the usage of the Fimat line because the trading volume is not covering its costs.   He wanted to know how to increase business with TyrellCorp.  I referred him to you.  As you know, he is so nice and not trying to start a fight with us but needs more trades to justify the cost of the line.  Will you please address this with him?  

Thanks, Sarah
