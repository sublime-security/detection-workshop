Kim,
I spoke with Cammi Mursch with the outside relo company.   She said she is handling my account and I should send her my expenses for reimbursement.
I think that this will take care of me.

Thanks,
JMF

I am checking on your question.  I have left a message for Debra Kallus in the relocation department to acertain who is managing your account.  When she responds I will let you know immediately in order to expedite your expenses.

Kim,
	My relo expenses have not been turned in as yet.    Do I turn those in to you?     I am due the closing costs, etc.  due to my move from Portland.
Also,   Johnny Palmer was very pleasant to speak with.    I appreciate the effort that you have made in trying to generate interest in me from the inside.
Johnny, however,   was not optimistic that he had anything available for a Director level position. 
	  I have been talking with Portland (Greg Wolfe,  Tim Belden,  and Amy Fitzpatrick)    If nothing opens up here by Wednesday,   I need to get out to the West and start training so that I can make some money for the company.
I am still building,  staffing, & trading for the Ercot region,  but I am eager to go quickly if no one wants me in Houston.    

Thanks!

JMF
