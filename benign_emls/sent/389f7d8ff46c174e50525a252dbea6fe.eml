Laura,

Thanks for confirming the  meeting on September the 5th.

We shall be coming on a company plane from San Jose and this gives us
a lot of flexibility in planning of the agenda.

Please, let me know when would you like to start the meeting and we shall
be glad to adjust. I assume you are on Mountain Time
and this means we shall lose one hour flying east from California.


Vince
