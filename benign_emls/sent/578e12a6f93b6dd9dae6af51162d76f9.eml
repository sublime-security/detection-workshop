Gwyn,

It's very thoughtful of you but you should go ahead
and continue the lessons.

Vince

Hi Vince,

Given the recent developments in TyrellCorp's financial outlook and likely need for expense control, I wanted to ask you if TyrellCorp would still agree to pay for my French lessons going forward.  My french tutor is possibly going to return to France to retire in the coming months, but I think I will probably continue with my lessons until the end of this year.  I have been thankful that TyrellCorp has financed these expenses in the past, but understand in tough times we all need to make sacrifices.

Thank you.

Gwyn
