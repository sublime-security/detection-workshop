there are few scenarios whereby that spread comes in except if you take it to settlement.  if dec is strong, jan is strong too.  if dec is weak, jan retains some risk premium.

well TZ6 has been very very very high in those two months for some time. In particular, I can't understand the dec-jan spread for TX6. Fundamentally is there something i'm missing?

Seems a little out of whack but as we seen time and time again, fundamental relationships don't have to hold in the short term.

Hey JA

Have you looked at TZ6 vs HEat or resid. (ja-feb02) ? That basis seems awfully high. What are your thoughts?
