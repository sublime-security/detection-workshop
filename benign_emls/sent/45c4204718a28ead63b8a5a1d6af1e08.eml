Krishna,

Do we want to meet with him? I don't see any point.

Vince/Krishna:

I am trying to firm up my schedule for this coming Thursady.  Is it time
from your perspective for us to get together and discuss how you might begin
to use NARG?  Give me an email or phone shout at (650)218-3069 to schedule
for this visit if you are ready.  Thanks.

Dale Nesbitt
