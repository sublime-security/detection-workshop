No problem at this time.  However,  when we go live,  we will have to book out with our counterpaties,  prior to flow.

Alex traded an hourly deal (HE 18 & 19 for 30 mws from  CPSB City of  San Antonio to Reliant HLP) on Tuesday afternoon, however, did not get the deal entered into the new ERCOT portal.  The scheulde was input into the old ERCOT oasis and the power flowed as scheduled.  I tried to input the schedule into  the new ERCOT portal, however, it was not accpeted b/c it  was not recieved prior to 2hour hourly ercot deadline.  This is for your information.
