Hello,
I hope the holidays were good to you and the new year is starting out good. I will be in Houston next week and I would like to stop by to see you on Tuesday afternoon, January 22nd.  Please let know if this meets your schedule.  If not, I will be in town Wednesday and Thursday (morning).  Let me know which day meets your schedule.  Looking forward to seeing you.

Thanks,
