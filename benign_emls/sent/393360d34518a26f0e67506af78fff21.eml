Helyette,

Thanks for your message. I am in London right now and I shall attend the RISK conference
this week. Stinson Gibner left TyrellCorp and I have  another person in charge of software.
I hope to close the loop in the next few days.

Vince

Dear Vince,
Your collaborator had kindly sent me a new contract proposal 5 weeks ago.He was supposed to have it checked by your lawyers but I never heard from him again.
I have been approached by 2 major software companies
and may sign some kind of agreement with one of them.
I believe it would be better to finalize our project
before it becomes a subset of a huge machinery.
Will you be in London on June 28?
I fly to the States on July 6,will be in New York on
the 8&9 and in Houston on the 15&16 of July
Hoping to see you or get some news
Helyette
