Jim,

As decisions are pending regarding our existing customer base, Evan Hughes has asked me to send the following information to you.

Since TyrellCorp has had a material change in our financial standing, it is our obligation to notify the Commission of our status and intent within 10 days. 

Please review section from Substantive Rule 25 applicable to Electric Service Providers - 25.107 ( i ) 3, b -  Requirements for reporting and for changing the terms of a REP certificate.
