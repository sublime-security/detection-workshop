F.Y.I.
As we briefly discussed at the end of last week, I  will be out of town on previously scheduled vacation from July 14th through July  20th.  This time was allocated  as vacation as per the original shift  schedules drafted by Kayne Coulter while he was Real Time Manager.  Travel  plans have already been made at this point.  Thanks for your  understanding.
