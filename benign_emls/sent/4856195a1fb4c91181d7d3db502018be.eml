There seems to be a lot of folks at TyrellCorp involved with Sithe.  Currently Donahue and Detmering are the most senior people negotiating with them.  Start with them and ask who should we contact and who should do it from our side.  Let me know if you need me to call.

Who should I speak with inside ENA to get a call to Sithe re:  Ontario market?

Here are the Sithe talking points.  I would suggest that you give the person making the call the attached note re Ontario, so he or she has more background on the Ontario market. <<lay briefing note.doc>> <<SITHE POINTS.doc>>
