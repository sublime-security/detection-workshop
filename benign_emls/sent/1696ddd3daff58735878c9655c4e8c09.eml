Frank,

Greg Whalley and I are planning another trip to a California.
The trip is most likely to take place on the 16th - 17th of August
or a week later (23rd - 24th of August). Are you available for an afternoon
meeting and / or dinner on Thursday, August 16 or August 23? 

We are very interested in your thoughts about the directions of the power 
markets across the US.

Vince Kaminski
