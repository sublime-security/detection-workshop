Donna & Becky --

Do you have any good points of reference on the history of natural gas restructuring?

Jim

Hi Jim- 

A lot of visitors that Jennifer and I tour are not familiar with TyrellCorp and even less familiar with our history and what started the gas commodity industry.  Given your expertise 
and knowledge of natural gas, I was hoping you would be able to recommend article(s)/book(s) and/or spend about 20 minutes with Jennifer and I to help us better understand the history of the natural gas industry, what problems and inefficiencies exited to bring on deregulating the industry and how gas became a commodity.  

Your help would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you.
