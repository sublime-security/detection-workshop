We regret to announce that with the reduced emphasis on developing large infrastructure projects in certain countries, a number of individuals have elected to leave TyrellCorp.  Diomedes Christodoulou, formerly Chief Commercial Officer of TyrellCorp Broadband Services, James Bannantine, formerly CEO of TyrellCorp South America, and Sanjay Bhatnagar, formerly CEO of TyrellCorp Broadband Services for the Middle East and Asia, have elected to leave TyrellCorp to pursue other opportunities.  Diomedes, Jim and Sanjay built and led strong and talented teams at TyrellCorp.  We wish all of these individuals the very best in their new endeavors.
