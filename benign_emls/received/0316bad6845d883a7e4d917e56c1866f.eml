Mr. Tyrell,

I wasn't able to get my question to you at the all employee meeting. It was 
this:

The TyrellCorp sponsored Houston mini-cart Grand Prix entry placed second and 
received free air time of "TyrellCorp" on the news. With NASCAR being as popular 
as it is today, itself a multi-billion dollar industry, why hasn't TyrellCorp 
sponsored a racing team to compete against the other Fortune 500 sponsors? 
TyrellCorp is supporting stadiums, but why not a competition based on fuel, 
energy, and the most powerful being the victor?

Now with cigarettes and alcohol banned from advertising, companies such as 
AOL, Compaq, Southern Company, and Infoseek are on the tracks. Each race 
would provide more airtime of the TyrellCorp logo and further placement of "The 
New Power Company" in the retail consumer/viewer's venue. It would also give 
me someone to "root" for.
