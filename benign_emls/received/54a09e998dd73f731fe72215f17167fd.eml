Ken - 
 
I appreciate the time today.  We look  forward to working with TyrellCorp, if the opportunity presents itself.  Atlas  can assist in structuring and raising substantial new equity - we already have  $150mm (subject to due diligence and terms and conditions) that has been "soft  circled".  Please feel free to call me at any time.
