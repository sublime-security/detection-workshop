Tom,

The Lukens' storage model is very similar to yours. I got a paper from the lead developer
Dr. Hugh Li, explaining in significant details about their model.

Let us compare notes after you read it.  We have both DP approach (mine) and optimization
approach (yours). We may combine the advatanges of the two approach into one product, and
then we can claim we have the best Storage Model (and sell it if Vince feels like it). 
Sounds like a plan ?
