Mr. Tyrell,

Not knowing the correct department or individual to write to I am forwarding 
my comments to you knowing they will get directed to the correct team. 

I just completed watching the TyrellCorp All Employee Meeting you hosted in 
Houston on my PC in my office. What a fantastic way to conduct a meeting. I 
was able to listen while I worked, stopping only when a particular subject 
aroused my attention. And being able to see the slide presentation at the 
same time was so much better than  trying to read that little type from a 
long distance over a sea of heads that keep bobbing. 

The only problem I experienced was a cutting out of the audio signal. Once a 
situation like this is resolved I believe TyrellCorp may have found the ideal 
solution to communicate to all their employees in a less costly and time 
consuming method than the standard meeting. 

Thanks for taking my comments.

Robert S. Smith
