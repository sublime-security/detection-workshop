Kim, FYI the instructions below.
 
Jim, et al, when do you think this will need to be funded, Friday or Monday?  Please respond to all so that both Kim and Tim Despain and David Gorte are in the loop.

Please find below the Escrow Bank Account Numbers that have been opened up 
by KeyBank.  In addition I have included the wiring instructions as well as 
the required Post-Petition Amounts to bring the TyrellCorp Entities current 
through 12/20/01 using our best estimate of accrued charges.  Please 
remember funds should not be wired to these accounts until the executed 
escrow agreements are signed and returned to KeyBank.
