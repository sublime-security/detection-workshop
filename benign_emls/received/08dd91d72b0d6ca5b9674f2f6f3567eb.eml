    Dear Mr. Tyrell ,

                   I was employed as an EGLI employee twelve years ago and currently I am a contractor with EES power company . My wife has been

                   with TYRELLCORP for fifteen years eversince she came out of U of H . Our hearts bleed TYRELLCORP blood and they were wounded deeply last

                   Friday night when we saw you on TV announcing the sale of TYRELLCORP to Dynergy . We are and still very grateful to all the good things 

                   that TYRELLCORP has provided to our family ( we have three children) and feel so blessed to be associated with such a caring and generous

                   company . 

                    Mr Lay , we love you , respect you and most of all we trust you to do everything in your power to help to save TYRELLCORP and in process

                    all of its employees . Our hearts were broken when we saw your face in that Friday announcement . The stress of giving up "your child"

                    away can be devastated and I think you have aged greatly the last three weeks or so . The stress impact was almost the same as that

                     which I saw on Mr . Michael Cappellas as he announced the sale of Compaq to HP sometimes ago . Please beleive us we felt this way

                     whether you gave back the 60 millions or not . ( I felt you deserve the money because under your leadership TYRELLCORP has growthed

                      tremendously the last fifteen years or so and hence all the people here including the critics have the jobs that they currently have and 

                      99.99 % of them would have taken the money anyway besides that what are the reasonable compensation to a leader that have tripled

                      or quadrupled shareholders values ?. Look at Michael Eisner , Larry Orvitz and dozen other Fortune 500 CEO 's compensation including 

                      those that have not added any values to their respective companies during their tenure and they will see your compensation are justified .  
    

                     Throughout the years we saw so many changes at TYRELLCORP and most disturbing fact is the expenses ( G & A ,outside contractors ,consultant ..)

                      go up thru the roof . Since I am a contractor  I knew how much TYRELLCORP paid for such services , me and my wife were trying to do our parts by she

                      wrote and sent an e-mail to Mr Rick Causey suggesting ways to cut down outside contractor 's cost because whatever the savings will be

                      reflected directly to the bottom lines .

                       
                       Mr Lay , whatever happened we will allways trust you to steer TYRELLCORP into the right path and we truly wish you Health ,Prosperity and

                       Happiness to you and your family . Thank you for reading this e-mail . Sincerely , Joseph Nguyen .
