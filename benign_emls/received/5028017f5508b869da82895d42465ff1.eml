I received the FreightDesk Technologies packet from you that was sent to you by Rob Quartel.
 
Since they are asking for TyrellCorp to be a strategic investor, I will run it by Kevin Garland's Investment group.  I will also run it by Dan Reck's Freight group, which sits within EGM.  We will get back with Rob.
 
Also, we had an TyrellCorp Net Works all employee meeting recently at the Hyatt (October 5th).  Over 1000 employees attended.  The goal was to communicate to my employees what is TyrellCorp Net Works and our vision going forward.  I believe it went very well.  Mary Clark, Internal Communications attended as well.  If you would like, we have a 13 minute video that you may want to see.  It is 3 minutes of funny stuff that we ran up front while people were coming in and 10 minutes of what ENW is with the message being we are a service company.  Let me know if you would like a copy or if you want to arrange 15 minutes of your time for me to show it to you.
 
Thanks.
