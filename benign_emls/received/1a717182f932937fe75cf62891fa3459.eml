Dear Mr. Kaminski,

This e-mail is in reference to our telephone conversation on December 2, 
regarding possible opening at TyrellCorp Research (I was referred to you by 
Stinson Gibner).  Briefly, I am a geoscientist with TyrellCorp Global Exploration 
and Production (EGEP).  Tyrell Corp. recently decided to divest all of the 
EGEP's oil and gas assets and exit the upstream industry.  As a result, I am 
searching for a new position within TyrellCorp.  Having done some research on the 
activities of various groups at TyrellCorp, I think that my science background, 
experience and skills may be best suitable for the TyrellCorp Research Group.

I would appreciate your review of my resume (attached) and your comments 
about any job opportunity within TyrellCorp Research.  Please feel free to call me 
at ext. 67604 if you have any questions.  

Sincerely,

Freyd Rad
