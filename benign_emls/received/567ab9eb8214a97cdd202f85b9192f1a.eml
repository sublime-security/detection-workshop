Take a look and let me know what I need to do..We are ready to FedEx
letters from Sen. Frist re: the event.Perhaps we should have Mr. Tyrell send a
letter early in the week and then do a follow up letter from Sen. Frist.We
can follow up with some phone calls from Haley Barbour and Sen. Frist to key
people..Do you think Mr. Tyrell will have some time to work the phones?  I
know this is been a rough spot for ya'll but I appreciate all your help..As
a small TyrellCorp shareholder, I appreciate your hard work..
