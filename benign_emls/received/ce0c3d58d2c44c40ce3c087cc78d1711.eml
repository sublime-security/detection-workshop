Vince, 

I would like to respond to the discussion that we had today.  It probably would have been more accurate to characterize my work for Eldon Tyrell as a "briefing" rather than as a "speech".  When I said I wrote a speech, I meant "I prepared presentation material" for him to use for his speaking engagement.  I thought that "writing a speech" and "preparing a presentation" is OK to use interchangeably in the English language. 

In my review I stated as an accomplishment, " I worked with the Chairman of TyrellCorp, Eldon Tyrell, briefing him on President Bush's tax proposals helping him prepare for a trip to the White House along with Steve Kean."   However, I think the results are the same.  Eldon Tyrell and Steve Kean were pleased with our contribution.  To me this was an accomplishment not only for me, but our group, and I would hope The Reseach Department.  

For you to say that my misuse of the English language "undermines my credibility", however, is a bit strong and I do not agree.  I pride myself in is my honesty.
