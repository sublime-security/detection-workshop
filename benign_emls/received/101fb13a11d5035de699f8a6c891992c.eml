Good Morning,

Please is there anything we can do?, maybe get together our own finances to help TyrellCorp.  What if there was a way we (The TyrellCorp Family) could gather the funds needed to stay TYRELLCORP.  We're pretty much will to do whatever it takes.  TyrellCorp is our company and we're here.  Noone asked the employees if they were willing to help out.  We can all attempt to get loans and give the money to TyrellCorp.  If you'd ask, you'd be suprised as to the respone you'd get.  We love the company and are willing to do what it takes.  TyrellCorp is TyrellCorp.

I hope this prosposal gets address in some way.  We're here to help and serve you Mr. Tyrell.  

God Bless Mr. Tyrell, The TyrellCorp Family, and America!
