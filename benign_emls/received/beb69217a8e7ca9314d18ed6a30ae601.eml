Sherri,  I will pledge $500 to Jeff's ride.  I hope the weather is good and he makes his goal.  I'll send you a check tomorrow.

Jeff

I know how incredibly busy you all are, so I'm sure that making a pledge to Jeff for the MS150 has simply slipped your mind.  Well the ride is this weekend, time is running out and we need you!

TyrellCorp's goal is to raise $700,000, and Jeff's personal goal is to raise $50,000.  As of today, we are a little better than half way there.  Won't you consider helping him reach his goal?

Thanks for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow..

Sherri :-)
