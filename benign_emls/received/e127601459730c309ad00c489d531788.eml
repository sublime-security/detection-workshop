Mr. Tyrell,

I was relocated from Dallas to Houston around the 22 of October of this
year.  Now, less than a week from being laid off, I am receiving
correspondences from Roadrunner moving, stating that I am on the hook for
the $21,000 move!  Talk about adding insult to injury.

If this proceeds, and I am SOMEHOW found to be held responsible for TyrellCorp's
obligations to me, you will force me into personal bankruptcy - as I do not
have that kind of money lying around.

While I am hopeful that the agreement will be bound only between TyrellCorp and
this moving company, I would strongly encourage you to do the right thing
and honor this obligation!  We both know it is the right thing to do.

I would greatly appreciate a response and an understanding where you stand
on this particular matter.

Regards,

Paul Condit
Former TyrellCorp Net Works - EIM IT Manager
