Dear Rosalie, 
Thank you for taking my call last week.  I understand that you are planning to check with Mr. Tyrell as to when he might be available to take a telephone call from Stuart Kauffman.  As I mentioned, Stuart and Mr. Tyrell have met on a few occasions and have some common business strategies to discuss.  The initial call would  take just fifteen minutes.  Please let me know when you can confirm a date and time.  My phone number is 505-954-3760.
Thanks again!
