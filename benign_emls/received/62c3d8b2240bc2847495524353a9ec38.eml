Family and Friends,
I just received this e-mail from a  girlfriend of mine and wanted to share =
her first hand accounts with you.   It put a lump in my throat and brought =
tears to my eyes.  I ache for those  people, all people, our nation and our=
 world.  May God bless you, and  may you feel blessed each and every day by=
 his presence!  =20
Love,
Robyn

Hi,
First, let me thank you again  for your thoughts and concerns. =20
I did make it out of the city for a  long weekend and truly got to unwind. =
 Many people out in the Hamptons are  contributing to the cause in several =
ways and like the rest of the country the  mood is somber. However, life is=
 still beautiful there.  I rode my bicycle  everyday, canoed, walked on the=
 beach and went to interesting dinners.  But  then I came back.  The bus I =
was on was stopped and searched before  entering the Midtown tunnel, which =
leads into the city.   Everyone,  including the driver was asked for pictur=
e ID.  I came back because Monday  evening started the Jewish New Year and =
I had dinner with my family in the city.   After dinner, my brother-in-law,=
 my cousin (visiting from Israel) and I  went downtown to ground zero.  It =
is off limits to anyone other than the  military, firefighters and the poli=
ce, but I got this unique opportunity to  enter the belly of the beast beca=
use my friend who has a restaurant down in  Tribeca set up a hot meal zone =
in one of the damaged buildings.  He and his  staff are the only non offici=
als allowed there.  I went to help serve.   Getting down was a struggle in =
itself.  I passed through many  blockades guarded by the military, and fina=
lly had a police escort get me all  the way down.  No matter how I describe=
 what I saw, I couldn't possibly  give an accurate picture of the devastati=
on.  The only thing I can tell you  is that it is so much larger in life.  =
The piece of facade of one of the  towers that you have seen on the news an=
d in all the papers spans one full city  block.  There were firefighting cr=
ews from California, Ohio, Indiana and  more.  I spoke with many.=20
Yesterday I went to synagogue.  The  experience was intense.  We waited on =
a line that went around the block  before going through metal detectors to =
get in.  I sat next to a Managing  Director of Cantor Fitzgerald, who was l=
ate to work on Tuesday.  He lost  all 200 of his staff as well as 500 who d=
id not work directly for him.  The  woman in front of me lost her son.  We =
had several firefighters visit the  temple and, as you can imagine, they wa=
lked into a full five minutes of cheers  and applause.  It was so touching.=
  No dry eyes.
I realize I'm  rambling but thought you might be interested in a first hand=
 account.
All  my best to you,
Joyce
