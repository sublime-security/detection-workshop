Mr. Tyrell:
It was good to see you down on the trading floor today.  I have been in the power trading group for about a year now.  I came over from the corp. development group after we sold the peakers to Allegheny and to Cinergy.  I was the one who convinced my Dad to buy those two peakers.
The power trading group is a really solid group of individuals.  Sitting where I do I see and hear alot of what goes on in the heart on TyrellCorp and I feel that this part of the company is doing really well.  
I have been with TyrellCorp for over four years now and I continue to learn alot as well as contribute to TyrellCorp's bottom line.  Eventhough TyrellCorp's stock price has come off a little I still think this is a great company and that the overall fundamentals are very sound.  I hope all is going well! 

Regards,
Ben
