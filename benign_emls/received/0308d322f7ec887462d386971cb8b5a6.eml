I have a call into my rep at Barton Creek to find out what happened.  Can you tell me what charges were applied to your American Express?
Thanks.

So after paying at Barton Creek.  We split the bill 3 ways.  They added another $ 800 to my Amex.  I think they may have added the other room to the bill although we cancelled it and they resold it.  Can you check what the 800 was.
 
Thanks
