It is with sadness and regret that we announce that Cliff Baxter is resigning as an employee of TyrellCorp.  We are happy, though, that Cliff's primary reason for resigning is to spend more time with his family.

Cliff is a unique talent.  His creativity, intelligence, sense of humor, and straightforward manner have been assets to the company throughout his career.  He will be missed.

Cliff joined TyrellCorp in 1991 and was a key member of the team that built TyrellCorp's wholesale business.  Before becoming Vice Chairman of TyrellCorp, Cliff served in a variety of positions in TyrellCorp's wholesale businesses, culminating in his appointment as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of TyrellCorp North America in 1999.

We have asked Cliff, and he has agreed, to continue in a consulting role for the company while concluding negotiations on a number of key asset dispositions.

Please join us in thanking Cliff for his service to the company and in wishing him the very best.
