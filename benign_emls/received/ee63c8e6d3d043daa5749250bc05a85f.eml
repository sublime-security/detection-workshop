Mr. Tyrell:
I am a former TyrellCorp employee.  I used to be proud of TyrellCorp.  I believed everything that you and EES management said.  I believe that the Vision and Values that you and other senior executives at TyrellCorp preached are not worth the paper they are printed on.  Respect, Integrity, Communication, Excellence.  I don't believe you respected the rights of so many TyrellCorp employees who sacrificed their family time so that the company would succeed.  I don't believe you have any integrity when it comes to fully disclosing TyrellCorp's future.  You obviously have not communicated the truth to employees, analysts or anyone else.  Maybe you should look inside yourself to see if you have the excellence now that you demanded from your employees.
 
I would like to see you take ownership of the incredible debacle that has fallen upon TyrellCorp.  So many of my friends and colleagues are out of work because of the gross mismanagement that you and others have shown.  I believe the least you could do is go on record and address these people at a time of year that is so special to so many.  Do the right thing and show some of the visions and values that you spoke so highly of not so long ago.  Show the men and women of TyrellCorp and Houston what you're all about.
 
Steve Beck
