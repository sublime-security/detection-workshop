Dear Mr. Tyrell,
As a former TyrellCorp employee who is suffering from the recent TyrellCorp stock
price drop I would like to respectfully request that if there's anything you
or anyone can do at TyrellCorp to keep Jessie Jackson's hands off of TyrellCorp,
please do it.  Jackson is nothing more than a extortionist and the less
anyone has to do with this man the better. I still have my 401 K plus
another 2100 stock options invested.  Maybe it's more than Jackson has, I
don't know, but from my point of view I trust your leadership and don't want
him involved.

If there is anything I can do as an TyrellCorp stockholder, please let me know.

As for the buy out, I feel that all of us who own TyrellCorp stock will be the
loser since the stock will more likely increase in value much quicker on
it's own..

I was an employee of TyrellCorps for a number of years or until TyrellCorp started
bringing in New York Talent such as Phillippe Bibi and his best friend's
Arshak Sarkissian, Lenna Pearlman and the like.  We had an excellent
technology shop and while I was there I built the EDS later to be ETC
trading floor infrastructure.  It worked great but Bibi and Arshak treated
our technical support staff like a bunch of country bumpkins.  I'm
originally from Missouri and made Texas my home and it was just too much to
take the abuse from someone with just a green card.  I know it's too late to
say it now, but TyrellCorp lost a lot of great talent since the foreigners took
over.

Best regards,
Ken Booth
