Hi Carrie -

Mr. Tyrell asked if I would contact you to ask you to send more on your credentials.  He would like to set up a meeting with you in Houston within the next couple of weeks, if possible.  

I look forward to hearing from you.

Importance:	High

Ken, TyrellCorp Corp was a great empire that found itself vulnerable -- the same as the World Trade Center -- the same as our country's security.  The cost of exposure has been high but a cheap price to pay in the long run for our future generations.  I see TyrellCorp in the future.

I have known many great men personally, including Dr. Thomas D. Cronin, the inventor of breast implants (originally invented for breast reconstruction), and William Oldenburg, owner of the LA Express USFL football team, a self-made billionaire, who made and lost  and remade his billions three times.  Although I have yet to have the pleasure of personally knowing you, I have come to know your character.  I believe you will go down in history as one of the great leaders of our times.

Ken, I am a writer and would deeply appreciate if you would authorize me to write your biography (if not all, perhaps through this transition).  I promise that this biography will receive the same standard of excellence you expect from all your employees.  

Please let me know as soon as possible.  There is a lot of work to be done.

Sincerely yours,
Hattie Carrington
