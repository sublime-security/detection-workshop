	Some additional information just provided by the State Department:  UnderSecretary of State Alan Larson met with Mishra and the Foreign Minister in his meetings in India and raised the need for the GOI to address and resolve Dabhol.  He received from them a commitment to "get the government energized towards a solution before the PM comes to Washington."

	The Embassy called to confirm that the Indian Prime Minister now plans to be in Washington on November 7.  We talked of a meeting on November 8 with the Secretary of the PMO.  Who would be best to take the meeting? 

	The US-India Business Council is also planning a letter to the PM which would underscore the short time left for negotiations and the need for the GOI to designate a schedule for meeting. One would think the PM would want to have made progress before arriving in Washington, but ..  John
