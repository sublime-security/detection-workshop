Vince,

 I was surprised at your comments in today's PRC meeting.  It must be my oversight for not sending you a copy of the briefing material that we provided Eldon Tyrell for his trip to the White House.  I spoke with Steve Kean after the meeting and he was pleased with our group's contribution.  I thought you also had an opportunity to speak with Steve.
