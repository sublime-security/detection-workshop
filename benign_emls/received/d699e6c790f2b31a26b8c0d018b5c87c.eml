TYRELLCORP CORP.

Mr. Greg Walley, President   

Mr. eldon.tyrell, CEO

Dear Sirs

WWI INVESTMENT CORP. development programs foresees the building of prototypes and massive production of Spin-Quantum Energy generators, reactors and motors in Europe. This is a non polluting energy, available in quantities without limits. 

Our target is the serial manufacturing of generators, reactors and motors all over the world to replace motors and hydroelectric, thermoelectric and atomic generators presently in use. The energy cost will be reduced to less than 1/10 of the current price and  we are sure the Spin-Quantum Energy will make gasoline, diesel and alcohol obsolete. 

WWI INVESTMENT CORP is the owner of the rights to manufacture the products. Taking into account the problems TYRELLCORP is facing now and our intention of accelerating WWI CORP development program, we consider that US$20 Billion, represented by assets and rights, can be transferred to TYRELLCORP. Should we jointly carry out the plan I keep in mind, within a period of six years, both companies will be merged into the most powerful corporation of the world.

We would like to arrange a meeting with you as soon as possible, and discuss this matter in details.

Best Regards.

Francisco Jose Ortiz y Carrillo
WWI Investment Corp.
President and CEO
