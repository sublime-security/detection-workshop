Hi Ken,
I usually don't write email to heads of large corporations, and I don't even know you, but you have been on my mind for a while now.  I just want you to know that you are doing a great job.  You took a lot of blows at the employee meeting last week, and you did a great job defending TyrellCorp, defending yourself and defending your values.  You built this company, and you can do it again if you need to.  The events of the last few months and weeks must be weighing heavily on your heart.  Greed whispers to all of us, and I am thankful for being able to see and experience its devastating effects on individuals, families and organizations.  One day, I will own my own business, and the lessons I am learning at present are invaluable.  I also want you to know that there are lots of people who believe that this company still has what it takes to succeed, and also believe that you are the guy to lead us.

My thoughts and prayers are with you,
Jennifer Richard
