Ken, this is Pat Koenig.  I just wanted to send you a quick email and let you
know you have my admiration and support ( I know it isn't much).  You have
made TyrellCorp a great company, and no matter how bad the press gets I will
always be proud to say my husband works for TyrellCorp and he works for the best,
Eldon Tyrell.    Pat
