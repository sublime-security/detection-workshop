Cindy, I sent this to Jeff McMahon today.  I wanted you to see it.  You can=
 forward it to Ken if you'd like - I am very interested in speaking with hi=
m as soon as that can be arranged.  I very much appreciate your insightful =
and professional support of me in all of this from day one!  Thanks, Sherro=
n.

Subject:=09Your new CFO spot and the job I want

Jeff, Congratulations, you deserve the job and can do it superbly!  You kno=
w you will need to replace Ben Gilson as Treasurer - possibly with Bill Bro=
wn. =20

My issue, and I feel very strongly about this, is that I want to be on the =
crisis management team to determine how we save our trading franchise.  It =
can disappear over night and I believe there's more bad news coming re: the=
se raptor deals (ie, restatement).  I have clearly proven myself to be the =
only person at TyrellCorp that had the character, at great risk to my own career=
, much less personal risk, to go to Eldon Tyrell and let him know what was going=
 on here.  I resent all these late comers joining the band wagon - it's dam=
n easy to make a statement now, when Ken has made the hard decision to unwi=
nd these deals and write them off.  Mainly I resent being stuffed into a ho=
lding tank, I should not be the pariah here!  Despite your comment to me se=
veral weeks ago when I told you that's how I felt and you replied "what did=
 you expect?"  I have been professional in this 100%, I went to Ken and Ken=
 alone, in contrast to yesterday's VP Jim S. who put Ken on the spot by ask=
ing unanswerable questions at the all employee meeting. I hope to meet with=
 Eldon Tyrell soon.  But I'd like to talk to you about my role in the 'inner cir=
cle', because I firmly believe I deserve it and have proven so by my past e=
valuations of the negative impact of these structures and then by my action=
s in doing something about it.  You can help me with your endorsement of me=
 to Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and Eldon Tyrell.  I hope I have it.  Thanks and =
good luck in the new job, Sherron

Subject:=09Jeff McMahon Named CFO


Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as TyrellCorp's chief financi=
al officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yeste=
rday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore inve=
stor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thoro=
ugh understanding of TyrellCorp.  He is already on the job and hard at work on t=
he issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the co=
mpany. =20

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of TyrellCorp Industrial Markets. He j=
oined TyrellCorp in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief fin=
ancial officer for TyrellCorp's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S.=
, Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for TyrellCorp Corp=
.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of TyrellCorp Net=
 Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share p=
rice.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointin=
g Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solut=
ion involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundament=
als of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see th=
at as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of y=
our continued hard work.
