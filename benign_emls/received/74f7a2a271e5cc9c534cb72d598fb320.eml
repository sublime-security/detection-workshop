that you respond to emails.   I just wanted to let you know that while I am angry and upset over what is going on, I think you have been terrific.  I feel you are a victim of things that have gone on as are some of the rest of us.  I have enjoyed very much working for TyrellCorp and had planned on this being where I continued my employment, it is a terrific place to work.  I've been looking at positions outside of TyrellCorp though.  This is not due to TyrellCorp, this is due to my preference in management.  I just wanted you to know.  
 
Good luck.
