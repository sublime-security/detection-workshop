After listening to your speech this morning, I am now, more than ever, proud to be an TyrellCorp Employee under your leadership.  Your commitment and fortitude under trying circumstances is always steady and going forward. During all the past years of success and truly phenomenal growth I along with my co-workers have been richly rewarded.   Not only was I rewarded economically but also my friends and superiors contributed huge amounts of time and money toward others less fortunate and able to help themselves.  

This is a direct reflection of your leadership and your giving back to the community.  This leadership by example is what will sustain us in the coming months as we build our stock back up.  I have no doubt build it up we will.  There is nothing more invigorating than a challenge to show your true courage and ambition. Shifting blame and finding scapegoats has never been your style and I am very glad to see we are not starting down that road.  I feel the up coming Chairman's Award will be a great boost to morale. 

People measure success very differently. I feel just as successful today as a year ago because I answer to a higher authority than our stock price. TyrellCorp's helping of our neighbors during the floods and the New Yorkers during their tragedies makes me very proud to work at this company.  Time is a better indicator of how well we persevered during these rather tumultuous times.  Here's to a better view in two thousand two. 

Regards Sherry Butler
