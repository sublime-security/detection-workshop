Mr. Tyrell,

I just wanted to let you know that I have been, and will continue to, pray for you during this difficult time.  I cannot imagine the stress that you are under.  I am so sorry that all of this has happened.  You have brought so much dignity, class and respect to this organization.  I know that you are trying to do what is best for our employees and wanted to say "thank you".
